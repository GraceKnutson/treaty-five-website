      <p>
        <span>In 1875-1876,</span> the federal government, Ojibwa people, and the Swampy Cree of Lake Winnipeg signed Treaty 5, also known as
        the Winnipeg Treaty. This treaty covered the Saulteaux, various bands that lived in the Beren's River region, and the Norway House
        region, as well as First Nations groups from northern Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario. The majority of modern-day central and
        northern Manitoba is covered by Treaty 5. Nothing beyond what had been provided to other first nations groups under the initial
        treaties was sought by the indigenous people who made up Treaty 5's population. The inhabitants of Lake Winnipeg and its surroundings
        had not been included by prior accords, thus they sought certain hunting and fishing privileges as well as recognition of their
        ownership of the region. Some groups also requested "treaty money," stating that other groups close to those covered by Treaty 5 had
        also received it. Additionally, two demands from certain bands contributed to the signing of this pact being a little unique. Along
        with monetary compensation, the band at Beren's River had wanted building equipment. Since the soils nearby were unsuitable for
        farming, the residents of the Norway House (located about 30 km north of Lake Winnipeg) were also suffering from starvation. This
        community was looking to move from the north of the lake to a region with better agricultural fields in the south.

      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        <span>The Indigenous peoples</span> of the Lake Winnipeg region were interested in signing a treaty with the Canadian government in the
        mid-1870s. They demanded that the government offer comparable financial aid, provision of tools, and protection against the
        encroachment of outsiders (such as surveyors and settlers) on their territory after learning of the concessions provided to the
        Indigenous nations of Treaties 1 to 4. The government initially had no interest in drafting a new treaty, even though it was interested
        in opening up the Lake Winnipeg region for potential development. The agricultural area in the West had previously been granted legal
        ownership by Treaties 1 through 4. With the Berens River bands and other villages near the lake, the government eventually consented to
        start treaty negotiations. However, they were not yet willing to negotiate a treaty with Indigenous bands north of the lake, even
        though they too had expressed a desire to enter into a treaty with the Crown. One exception was made for the Norway House band. The
        government consented to their request for relocation, and it was decided that the Crown would involve the inhabitants of the Norway
        House in any treaty negotiations.
