      <p>
        <span>The Numbered Treaties</span> were a series of 11 treaties made between the Crown and First Nations from 1871 to 1921. They cover
        the area between the Lake of the Woods (northern Ontario, southern Manitoba) to the Rocky Mountains (northeastern British Columbia and
        interior Plains of Alberta) to the Beaufort Sea (north of Yukon and the Northwest Territories). The treaties provided the Crown with
        land for industrial development and white settlement. In exchange for their traditional territory, government negotiators made various
        promises to First Nations, both orally and in the written texts of the treaties. These include special rights to treaty lands and the
        distribution of cash payments, hunting and fishing tools, farming supplies, and the like. These terms of agreement are controversial
        and contested. To this day, the Numbered Treaties have ongoing legal and socio-economic impacts on Indigenous communities. The creation
        of reserves, schools and other instruments of assimilation have affected Indigenous cultures, customs and traditional ways of life. In
        addition, ongoing disputes about the oral and written terms of the treaties pertaining to land use, fishing and hunting rights, natural
        resource use, and the like, have led to modern land claims. In order to address concerns about treaty fulfilment, the federal
        government established a policy recognizing comprehensive and specific claims in 1973. In spite of inadequacies in the treaty-making
        process, the Numbered Treaties have helped to guide the relationship between the federal government and First Nation peoples by
        providing a context of mutual responsibilities and rights. As modern land claims are resolved and concluded, the Canadian government
        and treaty First Nations work together towards improving the lives of Indigenous peoples.

      <h2>About Treaty Five</h2>

      <p>
        <span>Treaty 5</span> — also known as the Winnipeg Treaty — was signed in 1875-76 by the federal government, Ojibwa peoples and the
        Swampy Cree of Lake Winnipeg. This treaty included First Nations tribes located in the northern regions of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and
        Ontario, including Saulteaux, the number of bands that inhabited the Beren's River region, and the Norway House region. Treaty 5 covers
        much of present-day central and northern Manitoba. The aboriginal people that were included in treaty 5 wanted nothing more than what
        had already been offered to other first nations group under the original treaties. The people in and around Lake Winnipeg had not been
        included under previous agreements. They wanted recognition of their claim to the area as well as certain hunting and fishing rights.
        Other groups around those included in treaty 5 had also received “treaty money” and this was also a demand made by some groups. There
        were also two demands from specific bands that made the signing of this treaty somewhat unique. The band at Beren's River had demanded
        construction tools in addition to the monetary payment. The people of the Norway House (located about 30 km north of Lake Winnipeg)
        were also suffering from starvation, as the lands there were not suitable for farming. This community was looking to relocate from
        north of the lake to an area in the south that had more suitable agricultural lands.

      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        <span>In the mid-1870s</span>, the Indigenous peoples of the Lake Winnipeg area were interested in making a treaty with the Government
        of Canada. They had heard about the concessions offered to the Indigenous nations of Treaties 1 to 4, and subsequently demanded the
        government provide similar economic assistance, provisions of tools and protection against the encroachment of outsiders (such as
        surveyors and settlers) on their territories. While the government was interested in opening up the Lake Winnipeg region for future
        development, it was not initially keen on negotiating a new treaty. Treaties 1 to 4 had already secured title to the agricultural belt
        in the West. The government eventually agreed to enter treaty talks with the Berens River bands and other communities around the lake.
        However, they were not yet willing to negotiate a treaty with Indigenous bands north of the lake, even though they too had expressed a
        desire to enter into a treaty with the Crown. The land in the north had limited agricultural and settlement potential, and was
        therefore not a priority for the government. However, one exception was made for the Norway House band. Their relocation proposal was
        met with government approval, and it was agreed that the Crown would include the people of the Norway House in treaty negotiations.
      </p>

      <h2>Northern Adhesions</h2>

      <p>
        In 1905, the government wanted to acquire the land surrenders of peoples living in the North. Railway development, and the discovery of
        oil in the Mackenzie River Valley in 1920, also made negotiating a treaty with northern Indigenous groups a priority. Originally, the
        government decided that the Cree bands living at Nelson House and Split Lake would adhere to Treaty 10. On second thought, government
        officials realized that Treaty 10 provided larger payments and reserves than earlier Numbered Treaties. It was therefore decided that
        acquiring the adhesion of these bands to Treaty 5 would be more beneficial for the government. These bands signed the treaty. From
        there, the government expanded the treaty territory further by travelling to the mainly Cree First Nations of Oxford House, God's Lake
        and Island Lake. The Indigenous representatives from these communities signed the treaty in 1909. Lastly, in 1910, the Oji-Cree of Deer
        Lake East and the Indigenous peoples of Fort Churchill and York Factory were added, concluding the final formal stage of adhesions to
        the treaty.
