/* 
  NOTE: For this webpage I have chosen to use a monochromatic colour scheme, using the colours red and gray. The red has 
  been chosen because it is often seen as a very strong colour, used when you want to pull attention to something. 
  In addition, it is a similar colour located on many Indigenous creations and symbols such as the medicine wheel 
  and the bottom right of the treaty flag, thus I thought it would work well with the theme. The secondary colour,
  grey, pairs well with the red, and has been selected for many of the same reasons. In addition, grey is supposed 
  to represent strength and add a balencing effect to the webpage. Light theme is used rather than dark theme as there are 
  large chunks of text that would be harder to read otherwise. As I wanted the website to come across as a modern
  take on teh information given, I decided that a sans-serif font family would work best.
